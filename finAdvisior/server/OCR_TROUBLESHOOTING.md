## 🚨 **Common Issue: "No text was extracted from the document"**

This error occurs when the OCR system cannot detect readable text in your uploaded document. Here's how to fix it:

### ✅ **Solution 1: Use Better Quality Documents**

**What works best:**
- 📄 **Clear, high-resolution images** (at least 300 DPI)
- 🖨️ **Printed text** (not handwritten)
- 📱 **Good lighting** and contrast
- 📏 **Proper orientation** (not rotated)
- 💾 **Reasonable file size** (< 10MB)

**What doesn't work well:**
- 📸 Blurry or low-quality photos
- ✍️ Handwritten text
- 🎨 Complex backgrounds or watermarks
- 📏 Very small text (< 12pt font)
- 🔄 Heavily compressed images

### ✅ **Solution 2: Try Different Document Types**

**Best for OCR:**
1. **Bank statements** (printed)

### ✅ **Solution 4: Test with Sample Documents**

**Create test documents:**
1. **Simple text document** with clear fonts
2. **Bank statement** with printed text
3. **Invoice** with structured layout
4. **Receipt** with clear numbers and text

### 🔧 **Technical Solutions**
